# [Best Practice Premier](https://bpsoftware.net/) as Intune Win32
> [!CAUTION]
> This project is still a work in progress and is not yet complete, nor will it produce anything useful for intune at this stage. See [Roadmap](#Essentials) for more info.

## Notice
This script was tested on a Windows 11 Enterprise Multi-session (21H2) VM inside of AVD for Azure Stack HCI. As such, some parts of this script may need to be modified for your deployment if targeting Windows Server.

## Cloning
Cloning this repository is a simple process, although you must remember to include the `--recursive` flag! After installing [Git for Windows](https://gitforwindows.org/), navigate to the directory where you'd like to clone this repo into and run `git clone https://github.com/Jaika1/bpintunewin.git --recursive`

## Prepare
Before all else, I'd reccommend you take a dig into `Sources\BPconfig.ini` and ensure it's configured to go as you'd prefer. Once you've verified this, move on to any of the methods shown below.
### Method 0 - Read BP ISO from File Share
1. Deploy and configure a file-share if you don't have an existing one on your local network. Worst-case this can be a basic Windows Server VM hosting an SMB share.
2. Download your required Best Practice installer ISO. Place this ISO on the share and ensure it is accessable from your client machines in which you'd like to install best practice from.
3. Open `Source\Config.ps1` in this repo and edit all nessecary properties. `$installSource` should be set to `0`, and `$isoPath` should point to your ISO on the share you just set up.
4. After you're certain this has all been done correctly, Proceed to [Build](#Build).
### Method 1 - Download BP ISO from the Web
> [!WARNING]
> This method is not yet implemented. Trying to use this will always result in an install error, as it is currently hard-coded to do so ðŸ¤“
### Method 2 - Bundle BP ISO with .intunewin file
1. Download your required Best Practice installer ISO. Copy this into the `Source` folder of this repository.
2. Open `Source\Config.ps1` in this repo and configure so that `$installSource = 2`.
3. That's it! Proceed to [Build](#Build).
> [!TIP]
> You may still create and commit changes within this repository even after placing the iso in this directory as the root .gitignore file is configured to ignore .exe and .iso files.

## Build
Review and modify the `Source\Config.ps1` file as required. In particular, make sure you assign a correct path to `$isoPath` when `$installSource = 0`. This will be the location (including file name and extension) of the BP iso you downloaded and copied before in the [Prepare](#Prepare) step.
After properly following the [Prepare](#Prepare) section for your given scenario, Run `built.bat` and wait for the output to finish. Once completed, you should find your intunewin at `Output\Install.intunewin`. Once this succeeds, proceed to the [Deploy](#Deploy) step.

## Deploy
 - Open your [Intune Portal](https://intune.microsoft.com) and navigate to **Apps -> Windows**
 - Select **Add**. Under **App type**, choose `Windows app (Win32)`, then press **Select**.
 - Click **Select app package file**, then navigate to and select your `Install.intunewin` file.
 - Enter something informative into the **Name** field, and under **Publisher**, insert `Best Practice Software`, then select **Next**.
 - Configure the **Program** tab as follows:
   - **Install command**: `%SystemRoot%\SysWOW64\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\powershell.exe -windowstyle hidden -executionpolicy bypass -command .\Install.ps1`
   - **Uninstall command**: `%SystemRoot%\SysWOW64\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\powershell.exe -windowstyle hidden -executionpolicy bypass -command .\Uninstall.ps1`
   - **Device restart behavior**: `No specific action`
 - Under **Requirements**, set **Operating system architecture** to `64-bit` and **Minimum operating system** to the lowest supported by your version of Best Practice. Or just wing it if you know what you're doing, whatever works.
 - For **Detection rules**, set **Rule format** to `Use a custom detection script`, then browse for `Detect.ps1` in this repo. Leave other options the same.
 - Feel free to skip the **Dependencies** and **Supersedence** tabs if you don't have a specific use for them.
 - Configure the **Assignments** tab as per your requirements, then select **Review + Create**
 - Keep your browser open and connected to the internet as the intunewin file uploads and configures. Monitor the progress of this via the notification bell in the top right.
