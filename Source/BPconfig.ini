;The 'Options' key seen above is our primary focus. It has 6 numbers seperated by comma. From left to right, these indicate:
;1. SQL Server Version (1=SQLEX 2016 SP1, 2=SQLEX 2017, 3=SQLEX 2019)
;2. SQL Server Arch (MUST BE 2 AS ONLY AMD64 IS SUPPORTED!)
;3. Installation Type (0=Server, 1=Client)
;4. Install Medicare Australia Online (0=No, 1=Yes)
;5. EULA (Must be 1 for success. I'd hope that's obvious though!)
;6. Unattended Install (Again, we're aiming for a silent install so this must be 1.)

;As evidenced above, we only really care about options 1, 3 and 4.
